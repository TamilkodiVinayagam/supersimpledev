<h3 class="textcolor">The preparation of rasam involves a few basic steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Tamarind pulp or tamarind concentrate is mixed with water to create a tangy tamarind base for the rasam.</li>
    <li>Chopped tomatoes are added to the tamarind water and boiled until they break down and blend into the liquid.</li>
    <li>A mixture of spices including black pepper, cumin, and sometimes red chili is ground to a paste. This spice blend adds heat and flavor to the rasam.</li>
    <li>Mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and sometimes fenugreek seeds are tempered in hot oil or ghee. Curry leaves and dried red chilies are often added to the tempering for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>The spice paste and tempering are added to the tamarind-tomato mixture. The rasam is then simmered, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh coriander leaves are added at the end to provide a burst of freshness.</li>
